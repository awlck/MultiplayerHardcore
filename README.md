# MultiplayerHardcore

A Minecraft (Spigot) plugin for collaborative hardcore. Rather than banning a player when they die
(like the Vanilla implementation of hardcore does), create a new world and force everyone to start
over. Inspired by [this Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/lp8jjm/we_played_a_multiplayer_hardcore_realm_during/).

**Dependencies**:
* Multiverse-Core (4.2.2)
* Multiverse-NetherPortals
